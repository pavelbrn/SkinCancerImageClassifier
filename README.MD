# Skin Cancer Classifier - Modeled with a Convolutional Neural Network

This is a neural network model that classifies skin lesions as being benign or malignant. I documented my workflow in a jupyter notebook and put the entire training process inside a docker image. I wanted to show how versatile a docker image can be, because this model is now self contained and can run without any dependencies on any machine that downloads it, the result that the docker image produces is a CNN model that is saved on the local machine.  

My docker image can be accessed at: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/pavelbrn/tfdocker
